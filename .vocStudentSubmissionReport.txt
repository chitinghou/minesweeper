======= MineField checking =======
The following tests are checking the 1-arg constructor of MineField, and all the accessors
We use JUnit tests. If you fail certain tests, it means your return value is different than our expected value.
For example, if you see 'MineField - inRange test failed', it means you might have some problems with inRange() method.

========== Tests begin ===========

MineField - 1-arg constructor test passed
This test is for the 1-arg constructor. Your 1-arg constructor should accept the input array and create a corresponding 2D array which contains the mines in correct positions and maintain the correct number of mines. If you fail this test, it means the 2D array your constructor creates may be different from the expected array.

MineField - non-square case test passed
This test is for the 1-arg constructor but the input 2D array is not a square. In other words, the rows and cols of the input 2D array are different.

MineField - Test of defensive copy of the array passed
This test is to test whether your 1-arg constructor does a defensive copy of the input 2D array. To be more specific, if we modify the origial array passed as the parameter of the constructor, your 2D array for the MineField should not be modified.

MineField - 1-arg constr: populate and reset test passed
This test calls populateMineField and resetEmpty on a fixed Minefield which will never happen in game.

MineField - numRows test passed
This test is for the numRows accessor.

MineField - numCols test passed
This test is for the numCols accessor.

MineField - numMines test passed
This test is for the numMines accessor.

MineField - hasMine test passed
This test is for the hasMine accessor.

MineField - numAdjacentMines test passed
This test is for numAdjacentMines. If you failed the test, it means your numAdjacentMines does not return the expected number of mines adjacent to the specified mine location

MineField - inRange test passed
This test is for the inRange accessor.

SUMMARY of MineField tests: passed 10 out of 10 tests
